# Overview

Irrigation Calculator is the app that is able to help canal-based irrigation farmers calculate complicated water volume rates in comparison to trapezoidal (aka Ciparrelli) weirs. Being able to simple measure the depth of the water flowing over the edgs of the weir in inches, users input that number and are given back numbers in units useful to them.

# Future Work

* Figure out how to crunch the necessary numbers to incorporate the math and return more specific numbers.
* Work on being able to navigate to a new view without having to use the navigation functions that require the default title values. 
* Look into being able to make the app visually compatable with other size displays that will incorporate comparable views.
